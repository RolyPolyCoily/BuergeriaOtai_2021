## Overview
Here I provide codes used in a [study](https://doi.org/10.3389/fevo.2021.706887) published in _Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution_.  
RNA-seq files obtained in the study are available at DDBJ DRA (BioProject Accession: PRJDB12187).  
You can perform de novo assembly by yourself using qc2ppi.sh presented here and fastq files deposited in DDBJ, although, I can share the Trinity-assembled file generated in the study as per your request (send a message to [S.Komaki](https://sites.google.com/site/skomaki1987/home)).

## Overview
Here I provide codes used in a study that was accepted in _Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution_.  
RNA-seq files obtained in the study will be available at DDBJ DRA (BioProject Accession: PRJDB12187).  
You can perform de novo assembly by yourself using qc2ppi.sh presented here and fastq files deposited in DDBJ, although, I can share Trinity-assembled file used in the study if you need (send a request to [S.Komaki](https://sites.google.com/site/skomaki1987/home)).

## Overview
Here I provide codes used in a study which is under review in _Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution_.  
RNA-seq files obtained in the study is available at DDBJ DRA (BioProject Accession: PRJDB12187).  
You can perform de novo assembly by yourself using qc2ppi.sh presented here and fastq files deposited in DDBJ, although, I can share Trinity-assembled file used in the study if you need (send me an e-mail).
